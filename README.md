# Neural-Network-Face-and-Digit-Detection
A from-scratch implementation of multi-layer feedforward neural networks for image classification tasks. This project demonstrates deep understanding of neural network internals by implementing forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent without high-level frameworks.
